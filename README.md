## About extension-content-operator

The *extension-content-operator* implements implements the lifecycle management of a Kubernetes CRD `ContentConfiguration` resource, which is the API for configuration of Extensions in openMFP.

For reference, see the [RFC for openMFP Extension Management - CDM Processing](https://github.com/openmfp/architecture/pull/2/files?short_path=8a071a3#diff-8a071a31a02919a613572237f1e968fe02b9cf7d350c2cf796ba6b35495ec09b).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/extension-content-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
task install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task deploy IMG=<some-registry>/extension-content-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
task uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
task undeploy
```

### Run tests
```sh
task test
task cover
```
### Debug locally
```sh
task generate
task manifests
task install
task run
```

## Using a `validation` library

To install the validation library, add the following import statement in your Go project:

```go
import "github.com/openmfp/extension-content-operator/pkg/validation"
```

Example usage:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/openmfp/extension-content-operator/pkg/validation"
)

func main() {
    cC := validation.NewContentConfiguration()

    schema := []byte(`{
        "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
        "$id": "https://example.com/schema.json",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["name"]
    }`)

    input := []byte(`{ "name": "example" }`)
    contentType := "json"

    result, err := cC.Validate(schema, input, contentType)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Validation failed:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Validation succeeded:", result)
    }
}
```

### Debug Helm chart locally

```sh
# create local KIND cluster
cat <<EOF > kind-config.yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
EOF
kind create cluster --config ./kind-config.yaml

IMG_TAG=0.16.0

# build docker local chart image
docker build . --no-cache --tag local-extension-content-operator:$IMG_TAG

# load image to kind
kind load docker-image local-extension-content-operator:$IMG_TAG

# apply CRDS
kubectl apply -f chart/crds/core.openmfp.io_contentconfigurations.yaml

# change in imagePullPolicy in chart/templates/deployment.yaml
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

# apply chart with test configuration
helm template -f ./chart/test-values.yaml extension-content-operator --include-crds ./chart/ | kubectl apply -f -

# create sample resources
kubectl apply -f config/samples/v1alpha1_contentconfiguration.yaml

# cleanup
kubectl delete -f config/samples/v1alpha1_contentconfiguration.yaml
helm template -f ./chart/test-values.yaml extension-content-operator ./chart/ --include-crds | kubectl delete -f -
kubectl delete -f chart/crds/core.openmfp.io_contentconfigurations.yaml
docker image rm local-extension-content-operator:test
kind delete cluster
```
