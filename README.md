# SAP Repository Template

Default templates for SAP open source repositories, including LICENSE, .reuse/dep5, Code of Conduct, etc... All repositories on github.com/SAP will be created based on this template.

## To-Do

In case you are the maintainer of a new SAP open source project, these are the steps to do with the template files:

- Check if the default license (Apache 2.0) also applies to your project. A license change should only be required in exceptional cases. If this is the case, please change the [license file](LICENSE).
- Enter the correct metadata for the REUSE tool. See our [wiki page](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/display/ospodocs/Using+the+Reuse+Tool+of+FSFE+for+Copyright+and+License+Information) for details how to do it. You can find an initial .reuse/dep5 file to build on. Please replace the parts inside the single angle quotation marks < > by the specific information for your repository and be sure to run the REUSE tool to validate that the metadata is correct.
- Adjust the contribution guidelines (e.g. add coding style guidelines, pull request checklists, different license if needed etc.)
- Add information about your project to this README (name, description, requirements etc). Especially take care for the <your-project> placeholders - those ones need to be replaced with your project name. See the sections below the horizontal line and [our guidelines on our wiki page](https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3564976048#GuidelinesforGitHubHealthfiles(Readme,Contributing,CodeofConduct)-Readme.md) what is required and recommended.
- Remove all content in this README above and including the horizontal line ;)

## About this project

The *extension-content-operator* implements implements the lifecycle management of a Kubernetes CRD `ContentConfiguration` resource, which is the API for configuration of Extensions in openMFP.

For reference, see the [RFC for openMFP Extension Management - CDM Processing](https://github.com/openmfp/architecture/pull/2/files?short_path=8a071a3#diff-8a071a31a02919a613572237f1e968fe02b9cf7d350c2cf796ba6b35495ec09b).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/extension-content-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
task install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
task deploy IMG=<some-registry>/extension-content-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
task uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
task undeploy
```

### Run tests
```sh
task test
task test-e2e
task cover
```
### Debug locally
```sh
task generate
task manifests
task install
task run
```
